## 📖 What is it?

**ABS-KoSync Enhanced** is a powerful synchronization engine that bridges the gap between **Audiobookshelf** and **KOReader**. It ensures your reading and listening progress is always perfectly aligned, whether you're on your e-reader or listening on the go.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Five-Way Sync**: Syncs Audiobookshelf, KOReader, Storyteller, Booklore, and Hardcover.
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Whisper for precise audio-to-text alignment.
- **Web UI**: Full management dashboard for tracking syncs and matching books.
- **Split-Port Security**: Expose only the sync API to the internet while keeping the dashboard on your LAN.
- **Self-Hosted**: Runs entirely in Docker on your own server.

> [!TIP]
> **Upgrading?** Review `docs/getting-started.md` to potentially simplify your `docker-compose.yml` volumes. The new Forge tool and CWA integration reduce the need for multiple volume mappings.

## 📝 Branch Notes (`fix/perfect-ko-xpath`)

- **Enhanced KOReader Syncing**: The `LocatorResult` model and `find_text_location` have been updated to include and supply a `perfect_ko_xpath` calculation to ensure more accurate synchronization targeting.
