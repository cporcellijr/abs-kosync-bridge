## [4.0.0] - 2024-12-31

### 🚀 Major: Storyteller REST API Integration

**Breaking Change:** Storyteller sync now uses the REST API instead of direct SQLite writes. This prevents the mobile app from overwriting synced positions.

#### Added

- **Storyteller REST API client** (`storyteller_api.py`)
  - Authenticates via `/api/token` endpoint
  - Updates positions via `/api/books/{uuid}/positions`
  - Auto-refreshes tokens (30-second expiry)
  - Falls back to SQLite if API credentials not configured
  
- **New environment variables:**
  - `STORYTELLER_API_URL` - Storyteller server URL (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:8001`)
  - `STORYTELLER_USER` - Storyteller username
  - `STORYTELLER_PASSWORD` - Storyteller password

#### Changed

- `main.py` now imports from `storyteller_api` with SQLite fallback
- Dockerfile updated to include `storyteller_api.py`
- Startup logs now indicate which Storyteller mode is active (API vs SQLite)

#### Fixed

- **Mobile app overwrite issue** - Storyteller mobile app's 8-second sync cycle can no longer overwrite positions set by the sync daemon
- Uses timestamp leapfrog strategy for conflict resolution

---

## [3.0.0] - 2024-12-30

### 🚀 Major: Hardcover Integration

#### Added

- **Hardcover.app integration** (`hardcover_client.py`)
  - Auto-matches books by ISBN or title/author
  - Syncs reading progress to Hardcover
  - Updates reading status (Currently Reading → Finished)
  - Delta-based sync - only updates when progress changes >1%

- **New environment variable:**
  - `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` - API token from hardcover.app/account/api

#### Changed

- Sync cycle now includes Hardcover as fourth sync target
- Books are auto-matched to Hardcover on first sync

---

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-28

### 🚀 Major: Three-Way Sync & Web UI

#### Added

- **Three-way synchronization** between ABS, KOSync, and Storyteller
- **Web management interface** on port 5757
  - Dashboard with progress visualization
  - Single match interface with cover art
  - Batch matching queue system
  - Book Linker for Storyteller processing workflow
  - Suggestions page for auto-discovered matches

- **Suggestion Manager** (`suggestion_manager.py`)
  - Auto-discovers unmapped books with activity
  - Fuzzy matches audiobooks to ebooks
  - Presents suggestions for user approval

- **Book Linker workflow**
  - Search and select ebooks + audiobooks
  - Auto-copy to Storyteller processing folder
  - Monitor for completed readaloud files
  - Auto-cleanup after processing

#### Changed

- Uses `token_sort_ratio` for more accurate fuzzy matching
- LRU cache (capacity=3) prevents memory issues with large libraries
- Thread-safe JSON database with file locking

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 4.0.0

1. **Add new environment variables** to your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - STORYTELLER_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8001

   - STORYTELLER_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

2. **Rebuild the container:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down

   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify API mode** in logs:

   ```
   ✅ Storyteller API connected at http://host.docker.internal:8001
   Using Storyteller REST API for sync
   ```

If you see "Using Storyteller SQLite fallback", check your credentials.

### Upgrading to 3.0.0
